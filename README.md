# Core Data Structures & Algorithms
* Basics & Searching/Sorting: Time and space complexity analysis, binary search (both on arrays and on the answer), two-pointers/sliding window, and sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort).
Data Structures: Arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues (heaps), hashing, sets, multisets, and tries.
* Graph Algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), topological sort, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall), minimum spanning tree (Prim, Kruskal), and finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA).
3.* Dynamic Programming (DP): Techniques for optimization problems, including knapsack, subsequence problems, and tree DP.

# Specialized Topics
* Mathematics & Number Theory: GCD/LCM (Euclidean algorithm), modular arithmetic, prime algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes, primality tests), combinatorics, and Chinese Remainder Theorem.
* String Algorithms: Knowledge of KMP algorithm, Z algorithm, Manacher's algorithm, Rabin-Karp, and suffix arrays/trees is often necessary for harder problems.
* Advanced Data Structures: Segment trees, Fenwick tree (Binary Indexed Tree), Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find, and Treaps.
* Flow Algorithms: Network flow, maximum flow, min-cost max-flow, and maximum bipartite matching are part of advanced topics.
* Computational Geometry: Convex hull construction and sweep line algorithms can appear.

# Problem-Solving Techniques
* Greedy Algorithms: The ability to identify when a greedy approach is optimal is crucial.
* Recursion & Backtracking: Classic problem-solving methods often used with pruning optimizations.
* Bit Manipulation: Using bitmasks for subsets and clever XOR tricks to optimize operations.
* Meet-in-the-middle: An optimization technique for problems with exponential complexity.
